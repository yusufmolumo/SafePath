# SafeGuard: Emergency SMS Tracker

![SafeGuard Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150) <!-- Replace with your logo URL if you have one -->

**SafeGuard** is an Arduino-based emergency alert system that sends real-time location data via SMS using an **Arduino Nano**, **A6 GPRS Pro Module**, and **NEO-6M GPS Module**. When triggered by a button press, it delivers precise GPS coordinates, date, time, altitude, speed, and a Google Maps tracking link to a designated phone numberâ€”perfect for personal safety applications.

This project was developed as part of **CodeXtreme 2025**, emphasizing high-value, high-impact solutions to enhance community safety.
